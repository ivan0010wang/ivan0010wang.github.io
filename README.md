# Working Log

## Ivan: 
### 2020-02-24
      1. wrote sudo code for potentially necessary functions;
      2. researched how to make ranking system with JS, wrote sudo code and examples for reference;
      3. researched where to get weather info, no REALLY FREE api yet...
### 2020-02-25
      1. made a test.html in scripts folder for function testing only;
      2. made a function to show names of all restaurants. It's working but need improvements;
      3. made a function to screen all restaurants with patios.
### 2020-02-26
      1. made the names into buttons with on click functions;
      2. wrote the functions to show restaurant details.
### 2020-02-27
      1. rewrote the fetch functions into async for readability;
      2. rewrote all the other functions in callback function;
      3. gave the buttons onclick functions that can only add info in a div (should replace info instead of adding).
### 2020-02-28
      1. wrote a function to calculate the average score of a restaurant;
      2. things to do over the weekend:
            a. post request for user comment;
            b. link the score to the restaurant, ie. when I click the button, the score of the restaurant should pop up.
### 2020-02-29
      1. wrote the function to properly display score when a restaurant is clicked;
      2. wrote the function to show 3 restaurants with highest score.
### 2020-03-02
      1. fixed bug for displaying reviews;
      2. added a function to show 3 reviews of this restaurant when the name button is clicked;
      3. minor refactor in the function showRestaurantInfoAnd3Reviews.
### 2020-03-03
      1. added "active" state for restaurant buttons, ie. the clicked button will change style untill another button is clicked.
      2. researched how to post user comments with javascript fetch-post.
### 2020-03-04
      1. continued researching and testing, can make new entry in server, but the entry is empty.
### Things that can make this website better
      1. post user comment
      2. weather api
      3. show restaurant with patio
	  4. make **ALL** restaurant names clickable, show info of that restaurant when clicked.
### Post-Project Retrospective
#### Overall Experience
	Exciting, challenging, and frastrating (sometimes).
#### Most/Least Proud about Yourself
	Most: Putting pieces of code together can make some of the functions work!
	Least: Having errors in my console and could not figure out why...
#### One Key Learning
	**RESEARCH MORE** before coding
#### One Thing To Challenge in Next Project
	New things that I never used before.
