### 2020-02-25

      1. rewrote the fetch functions into async for readability;
      2. rewrote all the other functions in callback function;
      3. gave the buttons onclick functions that can only add info in a div (should replace info instead of adding).
### 2020-02-28
      1. wrote a function to calculate the average score of a restaurant;
      2. things to do over the weekend:
            a. post request for user comment;
            b. link the score to the restaurant, ie. when I click the button, the score of the restaurant should pop up.
### 2020-02-29
      1. wrote the function to properly display score when a restaurant is clicked;
      2. wrote the function to show 3 restaurants with highest score.

### 2020-03-03
